# Liftoff Competition

Competition management platform for Liftoff FPV Simulator. Remotely control your lobby — change tracks, kick players, run playlists with scheduled rotations, tag tracks by category and run random tag-based rotations, and let pilots vote to skip, extend, or choose a track category. Run weekly competitions with automatic scoring, league tables, and a playlist calendar that auto-rotates tracks all week. Includes a Node.js backend, live spectator view, competition page, and admin dashboard. Turn casual lobbies into league nights.

> **BepInEx game plugin** — the plugin that runs inside Liftoff lives in its own repo: [liftoff-plugin](https://github.com/geekhostuk/liftoff-plugin) (private).

## Overview

Liftoff Competition transforms a standard Liftoff multiplayer session into a structured, managed event. It connects a BepInEx game plugin running inside Liftoff to a server backend, which powers three web interfaces: a **public live view** for spectators, a **competition page** with season and weekly league tables, and an **admin dashboard** for organisers.

| Service | What it does | Exposed at |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **public-web** | Serves the public HTML/JS/CSS (live view, competition, stats, about) | `/*` |
| **admin-web** | Serves the admin dashboard HTML/JS/CSS | `/admin/*` (Basic Auth) |
| **api** | Express REST API — public + admin routes, auth, DB reads/writes | `/api/*` |
| **realtime** | WebSocket servers, plugin ingestion, domain services (playlists, tag runner, competitions, idle kick, skip/extend vote, tag vote), internal API | `/ws/*` |
| **postgres** | PostgreSQL 16 database — stores all race data, competitions, playlists, and admin users | Port 5432 (internal) |
| **nginx** | TLS termination, path-based routing, Basic Auth for admin | Ports 80/443 |

1. The **BepInEx plugin** captures Photon multiplayer events (races, laps, players, chat) inside Liftoff and sends them to the realtime server over WebSocket.
2. The **realtime server** ingests events into PostgreSQL, manages in-memory state, runs domain services, and broadcasts updates to connected web clients.
3. The **API server** handles REST endpoints for both public data and admin operations. Admin actions that need the plugin or domain services are forwarded to the realtime server via an internal HTTP API.
4. The **competition runner** (in realtime) manages weekly competition lifecycles — activating weeks, rotating playlists, and auto-recovering after server reboots.
5. The **admin dashboard** lets organisers control the lobby: change tracks, run playlists, send chat, manage players, and configure competitions.
6. The **live view** gives spectators a real-time window into the current race, track, and player activity.
7. The **competition page** shows season and weekly league tables with live-updating standings.
8. Commands flow back from the realtime server to the plugin to execute lobby changes (track switches, chat messages, kicks) inside the game.

## Features

### Lobby Control
- Change tracks remotely from the admin dashboard
- Kick players when moderation is needed
- Browse and search the available track catalog
- Full command/response protocol between server and game

### Playlists
- Create named playlists with ordered track lists
- Start, stop, pause, and skip through playlists
- Scheduled track rotation with configurable timing
- Resume mid-playlist after server reboot with correct remaining time
- Ideal for league nights, qualifying sessions, tournaments, and curated race events

### Track Tagging & Tag Runner

- Tag tracks with categories (e.g. `honk`, `technical`, `short`, `sg_playlist`)
- Managed tag list — admins create, rename, and delete tags
- Tracks are auto-discovered from the in-game track catalog (no manual entry)
- Search and filter tracks, assign multiple tags per track via checkboxes
- Per-track duration override — set a custom rotation time for individual tracks
- Local ID auto-populated from catalog; Steam ID editable for future Steam API lookups
- **Tag Runner** — standalone mode that randomly selects tracks matching one or more tags
  - Mutually exclusive with playlist runner (starting one stops the other)
  - Avoids recently played tracks (circular buffer of last 5)
  - Only selects tracks present in the current in-game catalog
  - Persists config to database — auto-resumes after server restart
  - Blocked when competition runner is auto-managed

### Tag Voting

- Chat-based category voting — players or admins can trigger a vote between tag options
- Players type `/tagvote` in game chat to start a vote with up to 4 random tags
- Vote by typing `/1`, `/2`, `/3`, or `/4` in chat
- Live tally displayed in chat after each new vote
- When the timer expires, the winning tag loads a random track
- Random tiebreak if multiple tags share the top vote count
- Admin-triggered votes via dashboard with custom tag selection and duration
- 5-minute cooldown between player-triggered votes
- `/tags` command lists all available tags in chat

### Vote to Skip
- Players type `/next` in game chat to start a skip vote (3-minute timer)
- Additional players type `/next` to add their vote
- Configurable vote threshold — when enough players vote, the track advances automatically

### Vote to Extend
- Players type `/extend` in game chat to start an extend vote (3-minute timer)
- Uses the same vote threshold as `/next`
- When the vote passes, 5 minutes are added to the current track timer before it auto-advances

### Idle Kick

- When the lobby is full (8 players), idle pilots inactive for 5 minutes receive an in-game warning
- After 1 additional minute without activity, they are automatically kicked to free up a slot
- Activity is tracked via gameplay events: checkpoints, laps, race completions, resets, chat messages, race starts, and race ends — so slow pilots on long tracks won't be falsely kicked
- Players can type `/stay` in chat to reset their idle timer (adds 5 more minutes)
- JMT_Bot (the host) is always immune and hidden from the admin player list
- Additional players can be whitelisted via admin API, admin dashboard, or `IDLE_KICK_WHITELIST` env var
- Only active when a playlist is running — free lobbies are unaffected

### Player Commands

- `/info` — shows available player commands, current mode, and time remaining
- `/next` — vote to skip the current track
- `/extend` — vote to extend the current track by 5 minutes
- `/stay` — reset your idle timer (prevents auto-kick)
- `/tagvote` — start a tag category vote (up to 4 random tags)
- `/1` `/2` `/3` `/4` — cast your vote during an active tag vote
- `/tags` — list all available track tags

### Competition System

- Create seasons with weekly competition weeks
- Automatic weekly lifecycle: `scheduled → active → finalised`
- **Playlist calendar** — assign multiple playlists per week; they run back-to-back and repeat for the entire week
- Playlists auto-start when a week begins, no manual intervention needed
- **Reboot resilient** — deterministic time-based calculation resumes at the correct playlist and track after a server restart, verifying and correcting the in-game track if needed
- Real-time scoring on every race close, plus batch scoring at week finalisation

### Points & Scoring

- **Race position** — F1-style points (25/18/15/12/10/8/6/4) based on fastest single lap per race
- **Most laps** — 1 point per 5 laps (capped at 10), plus 5-point lap leader bonus
- **Hot streak** — 3 points for setting the fastest lap in a race
- **Consistency** — 3 points if your lap time standard deviation is below the race median (drop worst 20%)
- **Most improved** — top 3 pilots by % improvement over pre-week personal bests earn 15/10/5 points; 3 points per new personal best on any track
- **Participation** — 10/20/30 points for flying on 3/5/7 days; 5 bonus points for 3+ different tracks
- Anti-gaming: minimum 2 laps to qualify, solo pilots get no position points, 2 participants = half points

- Persistent WebSocket connection for real-time status updates across all sections

> For a detailed breakdown of every dashboard section, all API endpoints, WebSocket events, and how the playlist and competition runners work, see **[admin-dashboard.md](admin-dashboard.md)**.

### Chat System
- View in-game chat live in the admin panel
- Send messages directly into the game from the browser
- Automated message templates triggered by events:
  - `track_change` — announce the next track
  - `race_start` — notify players a race has begun

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Server:** Node.js 23+, PostgreSQL 16+ (or Docker, which includes Postgres)
- **Plugin:** .NET Framework 4.7.2 SDK, Liftoff with [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) installed

### Server Setup

1. **Clone the repo and configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cd Server
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env`** with your own secrets:
   ```env
   PLUGIN_API_KEY=your-plugin-key
   ADMIN_TOKEN=your-admin-token
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://liftoff:liftoff@localhost:5432/liftoff
   IDLE_KICK_WHITELIST=              # comma-separated nicks immune to idle kick
   ADMIN_USER=                       # initial admin username (first run only)
   ADMIN_PASS=                       # initial admin password (first run only)
   ```

3. **Run with Docker (recommended):**
   ```bash
   cd Server
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

   This starts 5 containers plus nginx: API server, realtime server, PostgreSQL, public web, and admin web.

   Or **run locally** (PostgreSQL and both servers needed):
   ```bash
   # Ensure PostgreSQL is running and the database exists:
   createdb liftoff

   cd Server
   npm install
   npm run start:realtime &    # WebSockets + domain services (port 3000 + internal 3001)
   npm run start:api           # REST API (port 3000)
   ```

4. **Create an admin user** (choose one method):

   **Option A — via environment variables:** Set `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASS` in `.env` before first start. The user is created automatically if the database has no users yet.

   **Option B — via CLI:**
   ```bash
   cd Server
   node src/cli/createUser.js <username> <password>
   ```

   You can create additional users the same way. The `ADMIN_TOKEN` in `.env` continues to work for API/script access via Bearer header.

5. **Access the interfaces:**

   With Docker (via nginx):
   - Public site: `https://yourdomain/`
   - Admin panel: `https://yourdomain/admin/`

### Frontend Development

Both web projects use Vite for development with hot reload:

```bash
cd web/public    # or web/admin
npm install
npm run dev      # starts Vite dev server with proxy to localhost:3000
```

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build    # outputs to dist/
```

### Plugin Setup

The BepInEx game plugin lives in a separate repository: [liftoff-plugin](https://github.com/geekhostuk/liftoff-plugin). See that repo for build and install instructions.

### Production Deployment

For production with HTTPS:

1. Set up your domain's DNS to point to your server.
2. Update the domain in `Server/nginx/nginx.conf` if not using the default (`jesusmctwos.co.uk`).
3. Run `init-certs.sh` to provision Let's Encrypt certificates.
4. Run `init-htpasswd.sh` to set up Nginx Basic Auth for the admin page.
5. Create admin users via CLI or env vars (see step 4 above).
6. Start with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   cd Server
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

---

## Architecture

The server is split into two processes that communicate via an internal HTTP API (port 3001, Docker-internal only):

**API Server** — Handles all REST endpoints, admin authentication, and database CRUD. When an admin action needs the game plugin or a domain service (playlists, competitions, idle kick), it forwards the request to the realtime server.

**Realtime Server** — Owns all WebSocket connections (plugin, live view, admin), in-memory state, event ingestion, and domain services (playlist runner, tag runner, competition runner, idle kick, skip/extend vote, tag vote). Exposes an internal API for the API server to call.

Both servers share the same PostgreSQL database. The database layer uses the `pg` connection pool with parameterized queries throughout — no ORM.

### Database Migrations

Schema changes are managed via numbered SQL files in `Server/src/db/migrations/`. The migration runner executes them in order on startup and tracks applied migrations in a `_migrations` table. To add a new migration, create a file like `003_your_change.sql` in the migrations directory. The schema uses the `citext` PostgreSQL extension for case-insensitive admin usernames and tag names.

### SQLite to PostgreSQL Migration

If migrating from a previous SQLite-based deployment, use the included migration script:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-sqlite-to-pg.js --sqlite ./competition.db --pg postgresql://liftoff:liftoff@localhost:5432/liftoff
```

This copies all data from the SQLite database into PostgreSQL, handling foreign keys and sequence resets automatically.

## Running Tests

```bash
cd Server
npm test
```

## Who It's For

- **Race organisers** — reduce the friction of running structured events
- **League admins** — automate track rotation and manage sessions remotely
- **Community hosts** — give your club nights a professional feel
- **Streamers** — embed the live view for your audience
- **Anyone** who wants Liftoff multiplayer to feel like an organised event, not an ad-hoc lobby
